Write a program that uses while loops to perform the following steps:
a. Prompt the user to input two positive integers. variables: firstNum and secondNum (firstNum must be less than secondNum). Validate the user's input; prompt the user again if firstNum is not less than secondNum (use while loop).
b. Output all odd numbers between firstNum and secondNum. (use while loop).
c. Output the sum of all even numbers between firstNum and secondNum. (use while loop).
d. Output the numbers and their squares between 1 and 10. (use while loop).
e. Output the sum of the square of the odd numbers between firstNum and secondNum. (use while loop)
f. Output all uppercase letters. (use while loop).

Program layout:

int main()

{

     //a

        while()

        {

         }

     //b

        while()

        {

         }

 

     //c

        while()

        {

         }

 

    //d

        while()

        {

         }

 

    //e

        while()

        {

         }

    //f

        while()

        {

         }

 

}

 

***Use the main function only. 

***You assume that the user types only integer numbers.

***Do not use any pre-defined functions that were not covered in the class.

***Use only topics that were covered in the class.

***No object-oriented programming.

***Match the output below (OUTPUT section).

 

 

Submit your source code (file name is Assignment09_yourLastName.cpp). Make sure that it compiles using Code::Blocks.

If it doesn't compile, you will lose 50%. Improper indentation: -20%

If it doesn't produce the required results: -30%

Do NOT compress the file.
