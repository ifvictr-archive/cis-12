Write a value-returning function, isVowel, that returns the value true if a given character is a vowel and otherwise returns false.

 

***Collect the user's input in the main() and pass it to the isVowel() function. isVowel() function returns true or false.

***Use Call-by-Value (value returning function).

***Validate the user's input (allow only alphabet characters: a through z, or A through Z).

***Allow the user to repeat the program.

 

***Do not use any pre-defined functions that were not covered in the class.

***Use only topics that were covered in the class.

***No object-oriented programming.

***Match the output below (OUTPUTS section).

 

 

Submit your source code (file name is Assignment12_yourLastName.cpp). Make sure that it compiles using Code::Blocks.

If it doesn't compile, you will lose 50%. Improper indentation: -20%

If it doesn't produce the required results: -30%

Do NOT compress the file.
