Write a C++ program prompts the user to input the elapsed time for an event in seconds. The program then outputs the elapsed time in hours, minutes, and seconds. 

(For example, if the elapsed time is 9630 seconds, then the output is 2:40:30.)

Hint: use / and %

 

***Use the main function only.

***Match the output below (OUTPUT section)

***Do not use any pre-defined functions except ones that were covered in the class.

***Use only topics that were covered in the class.

***No object oriented programming.

 

Submit your source code (file name is Assignment01_yourLastName.cpp). Make sure that it compiles using Code::Blocks.

If it doesn't compile, you will lose 50%. Improper indentation: -20%

If it doesn't produce the required results: -30%

Do NOT compress the file.

Enter the elapsed time in seconds: 9630

The elapsed time in seconds = 9630
The equivalent time in hours:minutes:seconds = 2:40:30
