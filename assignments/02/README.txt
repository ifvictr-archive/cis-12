A room has one door, two windows, and a built-in bookshelf and it needs to be painted. Suppose that one gallon of paint can paint 120 square feet. 

Write the program that prompts the user to input the lengths and widths of the door, each window, the bookshelf; and the length, width, and height of the room (in feet). The program outputs the amount of paint needed to paint the walls of the room (no ceiling and floor).

 

***Use the main function only.

***Match the output below (OUTPUT section)

***Do not use any pre-defined functions except ones that were covered in the class.

***Use only topics that were covered in the class.

***No object oriented programming.

 

Submit your source code (file name is Assignment02_yourLastName.cpp). Make sure that it compiles using Code::Blocks.

If it doesn't compile, you will lose 50%. Improper indentation: -20%

If it doesn't produce the required results: -30%

Do NOT compress the file.

OUTPUT:

**********************************************************************

Enter the length and width of the door: 6 3

Enter the length and width of the first window: 3 3

Enter the length and width of second window: 3 4

Enter the length and width of the bookshelf: 5 5

Enter the length, width, and height of the room: 15 15 12

The amount of paint needed to paint the room: 5.46667 gallons.
