Write a C++ program to score the paper-rock-scissor game. 

Each of two users types in either P, R, or S. 

The program then announces the winner as well as the basis for determining the winner:

Paper covers rock,

Rock breaks scissors,

Scissors cut paper,

or Noboby wins.

 

***Use the main function only.

***Use only switch statements (no if statements).

***Be sure to allow the users to use lowercase as well as uppercase letters. 

***You assume that the user types only characters.

***Do not use any pre-defined functions that were not covered in the class.

***Use only topics that were covered in the class.

***No object oriented programming.

***Match the output below (OUTPUT section)

 

 

Submit your source code (file name is Assignment07_yourLastName.cpp). Make sure that it compiles using Code::Blocks.

If it doesn't compile, you will lose 50%. Improper indentation: -20%

If it doesn't produce the required results: -30%

Do NOT compress the file.
