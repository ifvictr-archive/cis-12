Write a C++ program that prompts the user to input three numbers. The program should then output the numbers in ascending order. 

 

 

Try the following combinations for testing:

1, 2, 3

1, 3, 2

2, 1, 3

2, 3, 1

3, 2, 1

3, 1, 2

3. 1. 1

1. 1. 3

1, 3, 1

3, 3, 3

 

***Use the main function only.

***You assume that the user types only integer numbers.

***Do not use any pre-defined functions except ones that were covered in the class.

***Use only topics that were covered in the class.

***No object oriented programming.

***Match the output below (OUTPUT section)

 

Submit your source code (file name is Assignment05_yourLastName.cpp). Make sure that it compiles using Code::Blocks.

If it doesn't compile, you will lose 50%. Improper indentation: -20%

If it doesn't produce the required results: -30%

Do NOT compress the file.
