Write a C++ program that prompts the user to input an integer between 0 and 35. If the number is less than or equal to 9, the program should output the number; otherwise, it should output A for 10, B for 11, C for 12 ...and Z for 35. (Hint: Use the cast operator, static_cast<char>(), for numbers >=10.)

 

***Use the main function only.

***You assume that the user types only an integer number between 0 and 35.

***No 36 if-else (or else-if) statements. Use 3 or less if (if-else, or else-if) statements.

***No switch statement.

***Do not use any pre-defined functions except ones that were covered in the class.

***Use only topics that were covered in the class.

***No object oriented programming.

***Match the output below (OUTPUT section)

 

Submit your source code (file name is Assignment06_yourLastName.cpp). Make sure that it compiles using Code::Blocks.

If it doesn't compile, you will lose 50%. Improper indentation: -20%

If it doesn't produce the required results: -30%

Do NOT compress the file.
