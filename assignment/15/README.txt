Write a program that uses while loops to perform the following steps:


a. Prompt the user to input two positive integers. Variables: firstNum and secondNum (firstNum must be less than secondNum); create a user-defined function called void validateUserInput().  Use Call-by-Reference.


b. Output all odd numbers between firstNum and secondNum. (use while loop); create a user-defined function called void oddNumbers(). Use Call-by-Reference.


c. Output the sum of all even numbers between firstNum and secondNum. (use while loop); create a user-defined function called void sumEvenNumbers().  Use Call-by-Reference.  Declare a variable called sumEven in the main() to store the sum of all even numbers.


d. Output the numbers and their squares between 1 and 10. (use while loop): create a user-defined function called void displaySquareNumbers(). Call-by-Reference.


e. Output the sum of the square of the odd numbers between firstNum and secondNum. (use while loop); create a user-defined function called void sumSqureOddNumbers(). Use Call-by-Reference.  Declare a variable called sumSquareOdd in the main() to store the sum of the square of the odd numbers.


f. Output all uppercase letters. (use while loop); create a user-defined function called void displayUppercaseLetters().  Use Call-by-Reference.

 

***Collect the user's inputs in the main() and pass them to  the other functions.

***Validate the user's inputs; in case the user types characters.

***Allow the user to use upper case or lower case.

***Allow the user to repeat the program. (use while loop).

 

***Do not use any pre-defined functions that were not covered in the class.

***Use only topics that were covered in the class.

***No object-oriented programming.

***Match the output below (OUTPUTS section).

 

Submit your source code (file name is Assignment13_yourLastName.cpp).  Make sure that it compiles using Code::Blocks.

If it doesn't compile, you will lose 50%.  Improper indentation: -20%

If it doesn't produce the required results: -30%.  Formatting output: -20%

Do NOT compress the file.
