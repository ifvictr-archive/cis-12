Write a program that reads a file (Data.txt) consisting of students’ test scores in the range 0–200.  It should then determine the number of students having scores in each of the following ranges: 0–24, 25–49, 50–74, 75–99, 100–124, 125–149, 150–174, and 175–200. Output the score ranges and the number of students.

(Run your program with the following input file: Data.txt)

***Use one-dimensional array to store the data from the file (Data.txt).

 

***Use main() function only.

***Do not use any pre-defined functions that were not covered in the class.

***Use only topics that were covered in the class.

***No object-oriented programming.

 

Submit your source code (file name is Assignment19_yourLastName.cpp).  Make sure that it compiles using Code::Blocks.

If it doesn't compile, you will lose 50%.  Improper indentation: -20%

If it doesn't produce the required results: -30%.  Formatting output: -20%

Do NOT compress the file.
